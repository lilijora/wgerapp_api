Description:
•	Login to user account
•	Create a workout
•	Add a training day to the current workout
•	Add an empty set to the current training day (configure just the number of sets, don’t add any exercise)
•	Try to edit the created set
•	Press the “Update” botton
Expected result: In this situation, after adding an empty set you should be able to edit it – to add exercises, to edit number of sets, number of repetitions, to select the repetition unit and weight unit.
Actual result: When you are trying to edit an empty set, after you press the “Update” botton nothing happen. The “Update” botton works like a “Close” botton.
Additional info: You should not be able to add an empty set, or the functionality of the edit option should be changed. In the current situation, you can edit number of sets, number of repetitions, repetition unit and weight unit just if an exercise already exist.
